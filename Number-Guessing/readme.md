# Number Guessing Game

Create a number guessing game that generates a random number between the range of 1 to 10. It will then ask the user to guess this number.

* If the user did not guess the correct number, it should give the user a hint by telling the user that it's lower or higher.
**For example:**
The game generates a random number 5.
The user guessed the number to be 3.
The game should tell the user: `It's lower, try again`.
It should then allow the user to try again by asking the user to input another number

* If the user guessed the correct number, it should print a nice success message along with the number of attempts.
**For example**
`Nice! You got it!`.
`It took you 5 attempts`
It should then ask the user if they would like to play again.
**For Example**
`Would you like to play again? (Enter Yes/No):`
