# Dice Roll Generator

Create a program to Roll Dice

* assume a maximum dice value of 6 and obviously minimum value of 1
* first ask the user to choose between rolling 1 or 2 dice. Valid user response should include any of `['1', 'one', 'two', '2']`
* print out to the user, the result of the roll
* ask if they would like to roll again
* use the os module to clear the screen after you’ve rolled the dice
